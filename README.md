# Nalton Software Website Readme

NOTE: Website has been moved to https://github.com/nalton-software/website.

## Changelog:
#### these versions are all 0.?.? because they are all pre-release

#### v 0.0 - ? Feb 2020
- I have problem with your moving thing: it moves stuff in main td off screen  
- I honestly prefer it with constant sidebar (at least on home page)  
- Sidebar scrolling WORKS!!!!!!!  
- made sidebar shown default (maybe only on home page)  

#### v 0.1.0 - ? Feb/Mar 2020
- added some more favicon/logo ideas (they are pixelated - but I can easily make bigger and less pixelated)
- I really like the one that is set currently
- The one that is set currently (the one with the squares inside each other) has no results in google image search
- I am making python program to make it go infinitely!!!!

#### v 0.2.0 - 16 Mar 2020
- Moved into repo using repl
- Mostly fixed layout - text now scales to width (sadly not with smooth transition)
- Added changing text to button

#### v 0.2.1 - 28 Mar 2020
- Just fixed a few small problems with layout
- I fixed the word-break so that it only breaks EXTREMELY long words (I think now it works like how it does in docs)
- Fixed problem where topbar was slightly (~5-10px) too wide and made side scroll possible - changed display to block
- Made changelog look better with bullet points
- Made everything v 0.?.? because it's a pre release version

#### v 0.2.2 - 6 April 2020
- We bought the server!
- Pushed a few projects, tests etc up. Also, this is my first time working from vscode on my main computer (not repl), so it's also a test
- Added my p5whiteboard project. The chat doesn't work yet, so don't get excited
- Updated upc to Nalton standard, changed ajax from get to post

#### v 1.0 - 8 April 2020
- Finally upgraded to version 1!
- Tweaked upc a bit more - added banned usernames, added noise on message receive, fixed bug where tags in message act as actual html tags, made it only redraw when new message - this allows highlighting of things in the output (without this, whenever it redrew, it would reset your selectionstart/end, messing up your highlighting)

#### v 1.0.1 - 24 April 2020
- Added Chatbox! It is in a seperate repo as node projects can't be in a folder and it works. Repo [here](https://github.com/Calbabreaker/chat-box)  
- p5Whiteboard should now be done.
