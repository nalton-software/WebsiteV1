Sidebar scrolling WORKS!!!!!!!  
made sidebar shown default (maybe only on home page)  

#### v 1.0.1 - ? Feb/Mar 2020

I really like the one that is set currently  
The one that is set currently (the one with the squares inside each other) has no results in google image search  
I am making python program to make it go infinitely!!!!  

#### v 1.0.2 - 16 Mar 2020

Mostly fixed layout - text now scales to width (sadly not with smooth transition)
